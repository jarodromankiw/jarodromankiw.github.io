      <h4>For the Brownies</h4>
      <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325°F (162°C). Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or foil, leaving overhangs on two sides for easy removal.</li>
      <li>Add butter to a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until fully melted, then turn off heat. Do not let it brown.</li>
      <li>While butter is hot, stir in sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Stir until fully combined. Batter may look gritty—this is normal.</li>
      <li>Let mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes until warm but not hot to the touch.</li>
      <li>Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each until smooth and glossy.</li>
      <li>Stir in flour and mix until batter becomes thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (about 40–50 strokes).</li>
      <li>Fold in nuts or chocolate chips, if using.</li>
      <li>Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan. It will be thick—press it into corners and smooth the top as best as you can.</li>
      <li>Bake until edges look dry and center appears just underbaked, about 20–30 minutes. A toothpick should come out moist but not wet.</li>
      <li>Cool completely before removing and slicing into 16 squares. For cleanest edges, chill in the fridge for 1–2 hours before cutting.</li>
      <li>Bake at 325°F for 18 minutes for fudgier brownies (adjust if needed based on your oven).</li>
